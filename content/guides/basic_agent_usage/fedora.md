### Overview

This guide will outline the basic functionality of the Datadog Agent.
If you haven't installed the Agent yet, instructions can be found
<a href='https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent'>here</a>.

The process to upgrade from the previous version of the agent is to simply re-run the installation.
